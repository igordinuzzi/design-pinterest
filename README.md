# Pinterest

### Background

Pinterest operates a software system that's designed to enable the discovery of information on the world wide web primarily through images, and to a lesser extent, GIFs and videos. Nowadays, Pinterest's primary focus is on providing the best platform for brands to connect with influencers.

### My Role

As the art director and senior communication presentation designer, my responsibilities were multifaceted. I led the creative direction of projects and developed communication strategies that aligned with Pinterest's branding and marketing goals. My role required a blend of artistic vision and practical design skills to create compelling visual narratives that engaged our target audience.

### Goals

My main goal was to highlight the typical Pinterest user's enthusiasm for helping brands enhance their online visibility, showcasing why Pinterest is the premier social media platform for achieving brand awareness. This involved crafting a narrative that not only demonstrated Pinterest's unique value proposition but also resonated with both brands and influencers on an emotional level.

### Design Process

I adopted the design thinking methodology and utilized various tools to generate innovative ideas and co-create an improved customer experience journey with the following objectives:

1. **Acquire an Exhaustive and Nuanced Understanding of the Social Media Environment:** This step was crucial for gaining deep insights into the social media landscape, including the needs and behaviors of users, influencers, and brands. By immersing myself in this environment, I could identify opportunities where Pinterest could uniquely meet the needs of its users and partners.

2. **Improve Pinterestâ€™s Effectiveness by Becoming a More Empathetic Service Provider:** My aim here was to enhance Pinterest's services by fostering empathy within the organization for the people we serve. This involved looking beyond the data to understand the emotional journeys of our users and how they interact with brands and content on our platform. By doing so, we could create more meaningful connections and experiences that would elevate Pinterest's position as a valuable partner for brand growth.

Throughout this process, I focused on collaboration and iterative design, working closely with teams across Pinterest to ensure our strategies and designs were user-centered and aligned with our business objectives. Through this approach, I contributed to creating a platform that not only served the functional needs of our users but also engaged them on an emotional level, driving brand visibility and awareness on Pinterest.
